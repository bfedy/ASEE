# Welcome {#welcome}

This book is being written to support student progress and learning in ERS 669 Applied Statistics in Environment and Ecology. Notice the present tense in the previous sentence. This book is a work in progress. The book is written using [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) which is a package in R that facilitates writing books with R Markdown. The book is provided as .HTML files on LEARN. This allows for a dynamic document allowing you to easily navigate through book sections and copy code. The book files will be updated on LEARN each week in preparation for our in-class programming sessions.
